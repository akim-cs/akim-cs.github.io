                                UrbanNa is a comprehensive mobile application designed to revolutionize how citizens report and track urban infrastructure issues. 
                                The platform creates a centralized system where users can easily document problems like potholes, broken streetlights, fallen trees, 
                                and other urban infrastructure challenges while providing officials with actionable data for informed resource allocation decisions.

                            <p>
                                The application leverages a modern tech stack built around Flutter for cross-platform mobile development, ensuring broad user reach 
                                across iOS and Android platforms. The backend infrastructure utilizes Node.js with Express for robust server-side operations, 
                                while Firebase serves as our NoSQL database solution for real-time data synchronization and scalable storage.
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>
                                A key innovation in our system is the integration of a machine learning model for image validation, which automatically assesses 
                                the severity of reported issues based on uploaded photographs. This feature enhances data quality and helps prioritize municipal 
                                response efforts based on actual problem severity rather than subjective user reports alone.
                            </p>
                            
                            <h3>My Contributions</h3>
                            <p>
                                As a core developer on this 6-person team, I have taken ownership of several critical components of the application. My primary 
                                contributions include architecting and implementing the user authentication system, designing the issue submission workflow, 
                                and developing the interactive map interface that visualizes reported problems across the city.
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>
                                I've been instrumental in establishing our development workflow, implementing Git version control best practices, and setting up 
                                our CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions. This includes automated testing with Flutter's testing framework and code analysis 
                                to maintain code quality standards across the team. The CI pipeline runs Flutter pub get, Flutter analyze, and Flutter test 
                                on every pull request, ensuring consistent code quality and catching issues early in development.
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>
                                Additionally, I've contributed to the overall system architecture by designing the modular folder structure that separates 
                                concerns across helpers, models, providers, screens, and views directories. This organization has proven crucial for team 
                                collaboration and maintaining clean, scalable code as we continue to add features like user upvoting, enhanced photo processing, 
                                and expanded login capabilities.
                            </p>
                            
                            <h3>Development Status & Future Plans</h3>
                            <p>
                                The project is currently in active development with regular weekly status updates and continuous integration testing. 
                                We've successfully implemented core functionality including user authentication, issue reporting with photo uploads, 
                                map visualization, and Firebase integration for data persistence.
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>
                                Upcoming features include enhanced user engagement through upvoting mechanisms, expanded authentication options, 
                                improved photo processing with ML-based severity detection, and advanced analytics for municipal officials to track 
                                problem patterns and response effectiveness across different neighborhoods and issue types.

                                Engineered and developed a full-stack web application to streamline wedding guest management, 
                                enabling users to RSVP, input guest details, and specify preferences such as dietary restrictions 
                                and plus-ones using JavaScript, Node.js, and Express.

                            <p>
                                The application was built using modern web technologies including JavaScript for client-side 
                                functionality, Node.js and Express for the server-side implementation. I optimized client-server 
                                interactions by leveraging HTTP requests and the Fetch API to efficiently store and retrieve 
                                guest data, ensuring a smooth user experience.
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>
                                A key component of this project was architecting a RESTful API with Node.js and Express, which 
                                facilitated seamless CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for guest records. This 
                                allowed for efficient data management and real-time updates to the guest list.
                            </p>
                            
                            <h3>Outcome</h3>
                            <p>
                                The application successfully simplified the wedding planning process by providing a centralized 
                                system for guest management. To ensure reliability, I validated client-side functionality and 
                                enforced robust error handling with Junit tests, which significantly improved the application's 
                                reliability and user experience.

                            <p>
                                Designed and implemented a command-line airline management system, processing over 15,000 flight 
                                records to enable bookings, payment handling, and itinerary management with ACID-compliant SQL 
                                transactions.
                            </p>
                            
                            <h3>Technical Details</h3>
                            <p>
                                I structured a PostgreSQL database to efficiently manage flight details, users, itineraries, and 
                                reservations, integrating salted password hashing to enhance security. This database design was 
                                crucial for handling the complex relationships between different entities in the airline system.
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>
                                To improve the user experience, I optimized search performance by developing algorithms that 
                                filtered 15,000+ flight entries down to the most relevant options based on user preferences such 
                                as destination, date, and price range.
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>
                                The project integrated Java, JDBC, and Maven to manage concurrent flight reservations, ensuring 
                                data consistency while improving booking efficiency. This approach allowed multiple users to 
                                interact with the system simultaneously without data corruption or conflicts.

                                The airline management system successfully handled complex booking scenarios while maintaining data 
                                integrity. The implementation of ACID-compliant transactions ensured that all operations were 
                                reliable and consistent, even in cases of system failure or concurrent access. The efficient search 
                                algorithms significantly improved the user experience by providing relevant flight options quickly.
